# KernelDensityEstimation

Homework assignment for Data Mining class. This program performs kernel density estimation on randomly generated data.
The algorithm is run 4 times with a different bandwidth each time. The results are then plotted against the histogram of
the randomly generated data.

The algorithm is run 3 different times, each with a different set of data.
The first set of data is a randomly generated set of 1 dimensional gausian data.

The second set of data is composed of two different sets of 1 dimensional gausian data with different means and variances. These two sets were then combined into a single set giving us a data set with two culsters

Finally the third data set was generated as a 2 dimensional set of gausian data
